# CppExamples
This is example code to test C++ concepts

This is a set of examples that I am writing to teach myself C++ concepts and to test various concepts that I need for other tasks.  Since my current work is being done in the the Eclipse CDT, so is this.  Since my current work is using Makefiles split by directories (not my decisions), so is this.

My hope is that eventually, I will have a rather extensive set of examples using many different concepts of C++.  Examples of using different objects from C++, and hopefully some unique ways of working with them to solve some problems.  This may go quickly at times and slowly at times based upon my capability to work on new examples and upon my needs for working with new concepts for my work.

I plan to implement several of the [Design Patterns](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Code/Design_Patterns) from this list.  These are quite useful in development situations and I need to know how to use them in C++.

I plan to implement examples using most of the [Data Containers](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/) from this list.  These are the ones contains in the STL and will be useful to understand on many projects.

I also plan to implement examples showing many of the [Concepts](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm) from this list as well as [Concepts](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept) from this list.  These lists also contain several data types that would be useful to understand.
